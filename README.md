Bootcamp homework #2 - Responsive Portfolio

## Description and Goal

This is a project to style our first real webpage. We were tasked to make this website responsive for mobile while using Bootstraps grid layout. We are also asked to use Bootstrap for other components, like our nav bar and other styling.

We created 3 paged that are all linkable to one another. One is a bio landing page, one is a portfolio with photos, and the last is a contact page.

### Technologies Used

Standard HTML for all of the pages with Bootstrap classes. Some of the components were copied and customized from Bootstrap. I used an additional styling sheet as well, for image formatting and color formatting.
